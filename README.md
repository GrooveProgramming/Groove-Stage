# Groove-Stage
This is a mock-up stage for Groove.

### Features
* Resizable layout
* Dynamically created sprite list and stage.
* Ability to add and delete sprites.
* Basic style.
* Ability to render sprites in different positions.
* Camera
### I will do soon
* Selectable sprites (click on the sprite on the stage, the sprite in the sprite list and the thumbnail in the sprite list.)
* Arrows for easy positioning, scaling and rotating of sprites (some icons at the top to change mode).

### ToDo
* Method of assigning costumes _(do we want to use the assets idea below?)_
* Saving all project data to json for saving to database.
* Loading from json.
* Merge with script and paint editor

### Ideas (please leave opinions)
* The assets area has reusable scripts and costumes. This is very powerful because as well as reusing scripts and costumes, you could assign scripts and costumes via a script, attach them to other sprites etc.
* Ability to call functions on other sprites. _(not sure how it would look)_.
* Ability to save code, scripts and sprites to a file.
